   <h1>Reasons Why You Should Stay Alive</h1>
   1. Your friends, your family, and your pets would miss you. <br /><br />2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. <br /><br />3. It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. <br /><br />4. There's so much you would miss out on doing. <br /><br />5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. <br /><br />6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. <br /><br />7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. <br /><br />8. You are amazing. <br /><br />9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. <br /><br />10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead. <br /><br />11. I love you. Platonically. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive. <br /><br />12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die. <br /><br />13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about. <br /><br />14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me. <br /><br />15. You're preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born. <br /><br />16. How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died? <br /><br />17. You're gorgeous, amazing, handsome, and to someone you are perfect. <br /><br />18. Think about your favourite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again... <br /><br />19. You'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day. <br /><br />20. Listening to incredibly loud music. <br /><br />21. Being alive is just really good. <br /><br />22. Not being alive is really bad. And boring. <br /><br />23. Finding your soulmate. <br /><br />24. Red pandas. Just&hellip; THEY ARE SO CUTE!! <br /><br />25. Going to diners at three in the morning. <br /><br />26. Really soft pillows. Or blankets. <br /><br />27. Eating pizza in New York City. <br /><br />28. Proving people wrong with your success.
